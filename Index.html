								<h5>3 new movies and TV shows Bostonians should watch</h5>
								<p>With movie theaters closed for the time being, almost every planned 2020 summer blockbuster is now facing a late 2020 or 2021 release date due to the coronavirus. Luckily, streaming platforms are still putting out plenty of entertainment in the interim, with scores of new shows and movies, including some films that were supposed to hit theaters first. The latest to lose out on its theatrical release entirely is “Scoob!,” an update on the Scooby-Doo franchise that brings Mark Wahlberg along for the ride as well.</p>
								<p>Beyond Wahlberg, there are plenty of new shows and movies that have local ties as well, including “Defending Jacob,” a drama from Chris Evans that was filmed all over Massachusetts.</p>
								<p>Here are three TV shows and movies that Bostonians should know about right now.</p>
								<h1>“Defending Jacob”</h1>
								<iframe class="rounded mx-auto d-block w-75 mb-2" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XQfeoRLvfqU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
								<p>Based on a 2012 novel of the same name by local author William Landay, “Defending Jacob” is set in Newton and concerns assistant director attorney Andy Barber (Evans) whose whole life changes when his 14-year-old son Jacob (Jaeden Martell, “It”) is accused of killing a classmate. The first instinct of Andy and his wife, Laurie (Michelle Dockery, “Downtown Abbey”), is to dismiss the charges as baseless. But as evidence against Jacob begins to mount, Andy takes matters into his own hands.</p>
								<p>Although “Defending Jacob” wasn’t part of the initial launch of Apple TV+, the series has clearly been a priority for the company, with a source involved in the production suggesting that Apple “spared no expense” while filming. At least 29 Massachusetts towns and cities were used for filming the show in 2019, including Boston, Framingham, Lowell, Lynn, Malden, Medford, Newton, Salem, Waltham, and Worcester. Evans even dropped out of a planned lead role for the upcoming Antoine Fuqua movie “Infinite” due to scheduling conflicts with the show, with his role going to Mark Wahlberg.</p>
								<p>How to watch: The first three episodes of “Defending Jacob” are now available on AppleTV+, with new episodes premiering each Friday until the May 29 finale.</p>
								<h1>“Selah and the Spades”</h1>
								<iframe class="rounded mx-auto d-block w-75 mb-2" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-nK6WFgdchM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
								<p>If you’re looking to escape reality for 90 minutes, “Selah and the Spades” will fully immerse you in the vision of first-time writer-director Tayarisha Poe. Set at the fictional Madewell boarding school (played in the film by the Academy at Penguin Hall in Wenham), “Selah” centers around Selah Summers (Lovie Simone), the 17-year-old leader of one of the school’s five underground factions who supplies the wealthy student body with booze and drugs. “Selah” doesn’t necessarily break new ground in terms of subject matter, but the film is a stylish one, and Poe makes you genuinely care about the characters and the pressures of high school hierarchy many of us long ago left behind. Along with Wenham, “Selah” was filmed in Hamilton, Peabody, Marblehead, and Newton.</p>
								<p>How to Watch: “Selah and The Spades” is available to stream now on Amazon Prime.</p>
								<h1>“Three Busy Debras”</h1>
								<iframe class="rounded mx-auto d-block w-75 mb-2" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CtJIoMUOGa8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
								<p>Since the end of her show “Parks and Recreation,” Burlington native Amy Poehler has been hard at work as an executive producer, identifying and elevating new faces in the comedy scene. The newest series exec-produced by Poehler is “Three Busy Debras,” an oddball comedy airing on Adult Swim about three suburban mom stereotypes all named Debra (Sandy Honig, Mitra Jouhari, and Alyssa Stonoha) living in the fictional town of Lemoncurd, Connecticut. If you’re a fan of surrealist comedy, this one is worth checking out.</p>
								<p>How to watch: New episodes of “Three Busy Debras” air at midnight on Adult Swim (listed under Cartoon Network on your TV guide) and are available on demand on the Adult Swim website with a valid cable subscription login.</p>

								<h5>Need some stuck-inside suggestions? This is what we’re reading, watching and listening to at WatchItOutsideBostonEdition.com.</h5>
								<p>With all the choices out there, you may need some direction. We've got you covered.</p>
								<p>Even if you’re lucky enough to have a job you can do from the comfort of your own abode, let’s face it: You’re bound to have more indoors “me time” than you’re probably used to during this extended stay-at-home period we find ourselves in. Fortunately, thanks to streaming services, e-readers, and online options like Boston Public Library’s virtual library card, you have a lot of ways to while away those inside hours — and if you need some ideas as to exactly how, the Boston.com staff is happy to help. Check out the list of the books, movies, shows, albums, podcasts, and indoor activities currently keeping us occupied below.</p>
								<p>“Why We’re Polarized,” by Ezra Klein. Don’t read it if you’re looking for an optimistic outlook on the near-term future of American government, but this books explains a lot about our current political moment — and got we got here. — Nik DeCosta-Klipa, Staff Writer</p>
								<p>I’ve been reading, and loving, “Leadership in Turbulent Times” (2018) by Boston’s own Doris Kearns-Goodwin. The legendary historian, in alternating chapters, traces the lives of Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, and Lyndon Johnson — dissecting the qualities that fed into their historic successes and evaluating how they overcame their failures, which in some cases were crushing. It’s fascinating, informative and, as always with Kearns-Goodwin, beautifully told. (Even if it does serve as a sobering reminder that in our own turbulent times, that kind of leadership can be awfully hard to come by.) — Peter Chianca, General Assignment Editor</p>

								<h5>Brian Dennehy, Tony-winning stage, screen actor, dies at 81</h5>
								<p>NEW YORK (AP) — Brian Dennehy, the burly actor who started in films as a macho heavy and later in his career won plaudits for his stage work in plays by William Shakespeare, Anton Chekhov, Eugene O’Neill and Arthur Miller, has died. He was 81.</p>
								<p>Dennehy died Wednesday night of natural causes in New Haven, Connecticut, according to Kate Cafaro of ICM Partners, the actor’s representatives.</p>
								<p>Known for his broad frame, booming voice and ability to play good guys and bad guys with equal aplomb, Dennehy won two Tony Awards, a Golden Globe and was nominated for six Emmys. He was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 2010.</p>
